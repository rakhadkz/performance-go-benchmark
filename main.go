//I created two structs with the methods to write and read from the shared channel of []bytes. String is not allowed, so we assume that slice of bytes is a word.
//Writer and reader works in different goroutines.

//Writer goes through the text and collects bytes to buffer until it reaches the space(which means the end of the word),
//or reaches the symbol which is not a letter(in that case we check do we already have a word in our buffer).
//After this it sends the content of the buffer to channel, and continues to go through the text

//At the same time reader listens to the channel. Whenever it gets the word ([]byte) it checks does it have the same word inside the slice of already written words.
//If it does, it increases the counter of this record, if no, it appends the record to it.
//After writer and reader both finished working with a channel, reader goes through the slice of words to determine the most 20 frequent words. I did this with an assumption that,
//any sorting between approximately 74k elements while reading, or quick sorting 10k elements after reading,
//will lead to way more comparisons than going through the slice and just retrieving 20 elements with the largest counter(10k elements in slice, 74k words in text)
//P.S Using one goroutine showed better execution time, idk why, but I decided to go with two goroutines version.
//I used approx 5 hours to code version with no goroutines, and one extra hour to code version that u see
